Hello github. Andrii is here. I really like Javascript, have read lots of materials on learn.javascript.ru and reactjs.org and practice it with writing some games.

Now I'm looking for my first job as Trainee Frontend Developer. I'd be glad to become a member of you developing team and do as much as I can.

Resume: [https://metkram.github.io/](https://metkram.github.io/)

p.s. It really warms my heart to know you read my README.md file. Have a good day
